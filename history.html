            The first known tools used to aid <a href="#">arithmetic</a> calculations were: bones
            (used to tally items), pebbles, and counting boards, and the abacus,
            known to have been used by Sumerians and Egyptians before 2000 BC.

            Except for the Antikythera mechanism (an "out of the time"
            astronomical device), development of computing tools arrived near the
            start of the 17th century: <strong>the geometric-military</strong> compass (by
            Galileo), logarithms and Napier bones (by Napier), and the slide rule
            (by Edmund Gunter).[1] 17th century <a href="#">mechanical</a> calculators The
  
            <i>Renaissance</i> saw the invention of the mechanical calculator by Wilhelm
            Schickard in 1623,[9] and later by Blaise Pascal in 1642.[10] A device
            that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all
           <br>
  
           <br>
            Pascal's calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and
            thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition.
            Schickard's machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a
            clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of
            multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of
            completing this operation. There is a debate about whether Pascal or
            Shickard should be credited as the known inventor of a calculating
            machine due to the differences (like the different aims) of both
            inventions.

            <br />
            [12] Schickard and Pascal were followed by Gottfried Leibniz who spent
            forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, the
            stepped reckoner, inventing in the process his leibniz wheel, but who
            couldn't design a fully operational machine.[13] There were also five
            unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th
            century.

            [14] The Grant <b>mechanical calculating machine</b>, 1877 The 18th
            century saw the arrival of some notable improvements, first by Poleni
            with the first fully functional <span>calculating clock</span> and four-operation
            machine, but these machines were almost always one of a kind. Luigi
            Torchi invented the first direct multiplication <a href="#">machine</a> in 1834: this
            was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of
            James White (1822).
            It was not until the 19th <a href="#">century</a> and the
            Industrial Revolution that real developments began to occur. Although
            machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed
            prior to the <strong>19th century</strong> , the refinement of manufacturing and
            fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made
            large scale production of more compact and modern units possible. The

            calculator, was released to production in 1851 as an adding machine
            and became the first commercially successful unit; forty years later,
            by 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold[16] plus a few
            hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany,
            1878 and Layton, UK, 1883) and Felt and Tarrant, the only other
            competitor in true <a href="#">commercial</a> production, had sold 100
            comptometers.[17] Patent image of the Clarke graph-based calculator,
            1921 It wasn't until 1902 that the familiar push-button user interface
            was developed, with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine,
            developed by James L. Dalton in the United States. In 1921, Edith
            Clarke invented the Clarke calculator, a simple graph-based
            calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions.
            This allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for
            inductance and capacitance in power transmission lines.[18] The Curta
            calculator was developed in 1948 and, although costly, became popular
            for its portability. This purely <a href="#">mechanical</a> hand-held device could do
            addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s
            electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical
            calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.

      <br> 
  The first mainframe <a href="#">computers</a>, initially using vacuum tubes and later transistors in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. Electronic circuits developed for computers also had application to electronic calculators.

  <br>
  The Casio Computer Company, in <b>Japan</b>, released the Model 14-A calculator in 1957, which was the world's first all-electric (relatively) compact calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on relay technology, and was built into a desk. The IBM 608 plugboard programmable calculator was IBM's first all-transistor product, released in 1957; this was a console type system, with input and output on punched cards, and replaced the earlier, larger, vacuum-tube IBM 603.

  <br>
  Early calculator light-emitting <strong>diode</strong> (LED) display from the 1970s (USSR)
  In October 1961, the world's first all-electronic desktop calculator, the British Bell Punch/Sumlock Comptometer ANITA (A New Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting) was announced.[19][20] This machine used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode tubes and Dekatrons in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode "Nixie" tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical comptometers of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later Sharp CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly 33 pounds (15 kg) due to its large tube system.[21] Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names "Plus" and "Sumlock", and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British Pilot ACE computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.

  <br>
  The tube technology of the <a href="#">ANITA</a> was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured Friden EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a 5-inch (13 cm) cathode ray tube (CRT), and introduced Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: Sharp introduced the CS-10A, which weighed 25 kilograms (55 lb) and cost 500,000 yen ($4555.81), and Industria Macchine Elettroniche of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time). The Victor 3900 was the first to use integrated circuits in place of individual transistors, but production problems delayed sales until 1966.
  
  
  The Bulgarian ELKA 22 from 1967
  There followed a series of electronic <a href="#">calculator</a> models from these and other manufacturers, including Canon, Mathatronics, Olivetti, SCM (Smith-Corona-Marchant), Sony, Toshiba, and Wang. The early calculators used hundreds of germanium transistors, which were cheaper than silicon transistors, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were CRT, cold-cathode Nixie tubes, and filament lamps. Memory technology was usually based on the delay-line memory or the magnetic-core memory, though the Toshiba "Toscal" BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of dynamic RAM built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.

  <p  class="pone">picture:The Bulgarian ELKA 22 from 1967</p>
  <br>
  Bulgaria's ELKA 6521,[22][23] introduced in 1965, was developed by the Central Institute for Calculation Technologies and built at the Elektronika factory in Sofia. The name derives from ELektronen KAlkulator, and it weighed around 8 kg (18 lb). It is the first calculator in the world which includes the square root function. Later that same year were released the ELKA 22 (with a luminescent display)[22][24][25] and the ELKA 25, with an built-in printer. Several other models were developed until the first pocket model, the ELKA 101, was released in 1974. The writing on it was in Roman script, and it was exported to western countries.[22][26][27][28]

          <h2>Calculation beginnings: The mechanical age</h2>
          <p>
            In the very beginning, of course, was the abacus, a sort of
            hand-operated mechanical calculator using beads on rods, first used by
            Sumerians and Egyptians around 2000 BC.
          </p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="img/abc.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="350" />
            <div class="image-text">The Abacus: Bean counter's friend</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The principle was simple, a frame holding a series of rods, with ten
            sliding beads on each. When all the beads had been slid across the
            first rod, it was time to move one across on the next, showing the
            number of tens, and thence to the next rod, showing hundreds, and so
            on (with the ten beads on the initial row returned to the original
            position).
          </p>
          <p>
            It made addition and subtraction faster and less error-prone and may
            have led to the term 'bean counters' for accountants.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that was where the technology more or less stuck for the next
            3,600 years, until the beginning of the 17th century AD, when the
            first mechanical calculators began to appear in Europe. Most notably,
            the development of logarithms by John Napier allowed Edward Gunter,
            William Oughtred and others to develop the slide rule.
          </p>
          <p>
            The slide rule is basically a sliding stick (or discs) that uses
            logarithmic scales to allow rapid multiplication and division. Slide
            rules evolved to allow advanced trigonometry and logarithms,
            exponentials and square roots.
          </p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="img/compass.jpg" alt="" width="350px" height="350px" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Even up to the 1980s, knowing how to operate a slide rule was a basic
            part of mathematics education for millions of schoolchildren, even
            though by that time, mechanical and electric calculating machines were
            well established. The problem was that these weren't portable while
            the slide rule fitted into the breast pocket of your button-down
            shirt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Real Rocket Scientists used slide rules to send Man to the Moon - a
            Pickett model N600-ES was
            <a href="apollo.html">taken on the Apollo 13 moon mission in 1970</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Gears, wheels and buttons</h3>
          <p>
            The first mechanical calculator appeared in 1642, the creation of
            French intellectual and mathematics whizz kid Blaise Pascal as "a
            device that will eventually perform all four arithmetic operations
            without relying on human intelligence."
          </p>
          <p>
            Pascal's machine used geared wheels and could add and subtract two
            numbers directly and multiply and divide by repetition. Gottfried
            Leibniz then spent the best part of his life designing a
            four-operation mechanical calculator, based on his ingenious slotted
            'Leibniz wheel,' but ultimately failing to produce a fully operational
            machine.

            This first commercially viable counting machine was manufactured from
            1851 to 1915 and copied by around 20 companies across Europe. If you
            want to see it working, here's a video...
          </p>
          <p>
            By then, the main tide of innovation had moved across the Atlantic,
            with the development of hand cranked adding machines like the Grant
            Mechanical Calculating Machine of 1877 and, more famously the P100
            Burroughs Adding Machine developed by William Seward Burroughs in
            1886.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the first in a line of office calculating machines that made
            the Burroughs family fortune and enabled the son, William S.
            Burroughs, to pursue a career consuming hallucinogenic drugs and
            writing subversive novels like 'The Naked Lunch'.
          </p>
          <p>
            A further step forward occurred in 1887 when Dorr. E. Felt's
            US-patented key driven 'Comptometer' took calculating into the push
            button age. This machine, too, spurred a host of imitators.

            The Curta calculator, which first appeared in 1948, was perhaps the
            ultimate expression of the mechanical calculator, so compact that it
            could, somewhat lumpily, fit into a pocket and was capable of
            addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

          <h2>Valve and tube calculators</h2>
          <p>
            Electronic calculating for the office had to wait on the
            miniaturisation of valves and the development of solid-state
            transistors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step was seen in 1961 with the arrival of ANITA (A New
            Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting). This was the world's first
            all-electronic desktop calculator and it was developed in Britain by
            Control Systems Ltd., marketed under its Bell Punch and Sumlock
            brands.

          <p>
            ANITA used the same push button key layout as the company's mechanical
            calculators, but these were the only moving parts. All of the
            switching was done by semiconductor diodes and cold-cathode,
            gas-filled valves - two Decatrons and myriad thyratrons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The illuminated 12-place display was provided by 'Nixie' glow
            discharge tubes. From 1962, two models were marketed; ANITA Mk. 7 for
            continental Europe and the Mk. 8 for Britain and the rest of the
            world, with the latter soon becoming the only model. These early
            ANITAs sold for around £355 ($1,000), equivalent to around £4,800
            ($8,000) in today's money.
          </p>
          Nevertheless, as the only electronic desktop calculator available, tens
          of thousands of ANITAs were sold worldwide up to 1964, when three new
          transistorised competitors appeared; the American Friden 130 series, the
          Italian IME 84, and the Sharp Compet CS10A from Japan.
