               Except for the Antikythera mechanism (an "out of the time"
               astronomical device), development of computing tools arrived near the
               start of the 17th century: <strong>the geometric-military</strong> compass (by
               Galileo), logarithms and Napier bones (by Napier), and the slide rule

            A calculator is a device or tool used for performing mathematical calculations. 
            It can range from simple handheld devices with basic arithmetic functions to complex scientific or 
            graphing calculators capable of performing advanced mathematical operations. Calculators can be physical devices, 
            software applications on computers or mobile devices, or even built into web browsers. They are widely used in various 
            fields such as education, engineering, finance, and everyday life for tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to complex 
            scientific computations.</p>

           <p class="mb-3">The Grant mechanical calculating machine, 1877</p>
           <p class="mb-4">The 18th century saw the arrival of some notable improvements, first
            by Poleni with the first fully functional
            <span>calculating clock</span> and four-operation machine, but these
            machines were almost always one of a kind. Luigi Torchi invented the
            first direct multiplication
            <a href="#" class="text-white">machine</a> in 1834: this was also the
            second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White
            (1822).</p>

          If you need an illustration of the accelerating speed of technological change, look no further than the
          electronic calculator, that modest little device that does the most complex sum instantly and that you hold
          in the palm of your hand.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Calculation beginnings: The mechanical age</h2>
      <p>
          In the very beginning, of course, was the abacus, a sort of hand-operated mechanical calculator using beads
          on rods, first used by Sumerians and Egyptians around 2000 BC.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
          <img src="img/abc.jpg" alt="The Abacus: Bean counter's friend" width="350" height="350" />
          <div class="image-text">The Abacus: Bean counter's friend</div>
      </div>
      <p>
          The principle was simple, a frame holding a series of rods, with ten sliding beads on each. When all the
          beads had been slid across the first rod, it was time to move one across on the next, showing the number of
          tens, and thence to the next rod, showing hundreds, and so on (with the ten beads on the initial row
          returned to the original position).
      </p>
      <p>
          It made addition and subtraction faster and less error-prone and may have led to the term 'bean counters'
          for accountants.
      </p>
      <p>
          But that was where the technology more or less stuck for the next 3,600 years, until the beginning of the
          17th century AD, when the first mechanical calculators began to appear in Europe. Most notably, the
          development of logarithms by John Napier allowed Edward Gunter, William Oughtred and others to develop the
          slide rule.
      </p>
      <p>
          The slide rule is basically a sliding stick (or discs) that uses logarithmic scales to allow rapid
          multiplication and division. Slide rules evolved to allow advanced trigonometry and logarithms, exponentials
          and square roots.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
          <img src="img/compass.jpg" alt="Slide Rule" width="350" height="350" />
      </div>
      <p>
          Even up to the 1980s, knowing how to operate a slide rule was a basic part of mathematics education for
          millions of schoolchildren, even though by that time, mechanical and electric calculating machines were well
          established. The problem was that these weren't portable while the slide rule fitted into the breast pocket
          of your button-down shirt.
      </p>
      <p>
          Real Rocket Scientists used slide rules to send Man to the Moon - a Pickett model N600-ES was <a href="apollo.html">taken on the Apollo 13 moon mission in 1970</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Gears, wheels and buttons</h3>
      <p>
          The first mechanical calculator appeared in 1642, the creation of French intellectual and mathematics
          whizz kid Blaise Pascal as "a device that will eventually perform all four arithmetic operations without
          relying on human intelligence."
      </p>
      <p>
          Pascal's machine used geared wheels and could add and subtract two numbers directly and multiply and divide
          by repetition. Gottfried Leibniz then spent the best part of his life designing a four-operation mechanical
          calculator, based on his ingenious slotted 'Leibniz wheel,' but ultimately failing to produce a fully
          operational machine.

          That had to wait until 1820 and the patenting in France of <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=448">Thomas de Colmar's four function Arithmometer</a>.

      <p>
          This first commercially viable counting machine was manufactured from 1851 to 1915 and copied by around 20
          companies across Europe. If you want to see it working, here's a video...
      </p>
      <p>
          By then, the main tide of innovation had moved across the Atlantic, with the development of hand cranked
          adding machines like the Grant Mechanical Calculating Machine of 1877 and, more famously the P100 Burroughs
          Adding Machine developed by William Seward Burroughs in 1886.
      </p>
      <p>
          This was the first in a line of office calculating machines that made the Burroughs family fortune and
          enabled the son, William S. Burroughs, to pursue a career consuming hallucinogenic drugs and writing
          subversive novels like 'The Naked Lunch'.
      </p>
      <p>
          A further step forward occurred in 1887 when Dorr. E. Felt's US-patented key driven 'Comptometer' took
          calculating into the push button age. This machine, too, spurred a host of imitators.

          The Curta calculator, which first appeared in 1948, was perhaps the ultimate expression of the mechanical
          calculator, so compact that it could, somewhat lumpily, fit into a pocket and was capable of addition,
          subtraction, multiplication and division.

      <h2>Valve and tube calculators</h2>
      <p>
          Electronic calculating for the office had to wait on the miniaturisation of valves and the development of
          solid-state transistors.
      </p>
      <p>
          The first step was seen in 1961 with the arrival of ANITA (A New Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting).
          This was the world's first all-electronic desktop calculator and it was developed in Britain by Control
          Systems Ltd., marketed under its Bell Punch and Sumlock brands.
      </p>
      <div>
          <img src="img/anita.jpg" alt="ANITA: First desktop all-electronic calculator" width="350" height="350" />
          <p>
              ANITA: First desktop all-electronic calculator. Useful for working out your <a href="https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/margin-calculator.php">business margins</a>
          </p>
      </div>
      <p>
          ANITA used the same push button key layout as the company's mechanical calculators, but these were the only
          moving parts. All of the switching was done by semiconductor diodes and cold-cathode, gas-filled valves -
          two Decatrons and myriad thyratrons.
      </p>
      <p>
          The illuminated 12-place display was provided by 'Nixie' glow discharge tubes. From 1962, two models were
          marketed; ANITA Mk. 7 for continental Europe and the Mk. 8 for Britain and the rest of the world, with the
          latter soon becoming the only model. These early ANITAs sold for around £355 ($1,000), equivalent to around
          £4,800 ($8,000) in today's money.
      </p>
      <p>
          Nevertheless, as the only electronic desktop calculator available, tens of thousands of ANITAs were sold
          worldwide up to 1964, when three new transistorised competitors appeared; the American Friden 130 series,
          the Italian IME 84, and the Sharp Compet CS10A from Japan.
