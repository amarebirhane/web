        <h3>History of calculator</h3>
        <p >
          The first known tools used to aid <a href="#">arithmetic</a> calculations were: bones
          (used to tally items), pebbles, and counting boards, and the abacus,
          known to have been used by Sumerians and Egyptians before 2000 BC.

          <br>
          Except for the Antikythera mechanism (an "out of the time"
          astronomical device), development of computing tools arrived near the
          start of the 17th century: <strong>the geometric-military</strong> compass (by
          Galileo), logarithms and Napier bones (by Napier), and the slide rule
          (by Edmund Gunter).[1] 17th century <a href="#">mechanical</a> calculators The

          <i>Renaissance</i> saw the invention of the mechanical calculator by Wilhelm
          Schickard in 1623,[9] and later by Blaise Pascal in 1642.[10] A device
          that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all
         <br>

         <br>
          Pascal's calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and
          thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition.
          Schickard's machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a
          clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of
          multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of
          completing this operation. There is a debate about whether Pascal or
          Shickard should be credited as the known inventor of a calculating
          machine due to the differences (like the different aims) of both
          inventions.

          <br />
          [12] Schickard and Pascal were followed by Gottfried Leibniz who spent
          forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, the
          stepped reckoner, inventing in the process his leibniz wheel, but who
          couldn't design a fully operational machine.[13] There were also five
          unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th
          century.

          [14] The Grant <b>mechanical calculating machine</b>, 1877 The 18th
          century saw the arrival of some notable improvements, first by Poleni
          with the first fully functional <span>calculating clock</span> and four-operation
          machine, but these machines were almost always one of a kind. Luigi
          Torchi invented the first direct multiplication <a href="#">machine</a> in 1834: this
          was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of
          James White (1822).
          It was not until the 19th <a href="#">century</a> and the
          Industrial Revolution that real developments began to occur. Although
          machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed
          prior to the <strong>19th century</strong> , the refinement of manufacturing and
          fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made
          large scale production of more compact and modern units possible. The
          Arithmometer, invented in 1820 as a four-operation mechanical

          calculator, was released to production in 1851 as an adding machine
          and became the first commercially successful unit; forty years later,
          by 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold[16] plus a few
          hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany,
          1878 and Layton, UK, 1883) and Felt and Tarrant, the only other
          competitor in true <a href="#">commercial</a> production, had sold 100
          comptometers.[17] Patent image of the Clarke graph-based calculator,
          1921 It wasn't until 1902 that the familiar push-button user interface
          was developed, with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine,
          developed by James L. Dalton in the United States. In 1921, Edith
          Clarke invented the Clarke calculator, a simple graph-based
          calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions.
          This allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for
          inductance and capacitance in power transmission lines.[18] The Curta
          calculator was developed in 1948 and, although costly, became popular
          for its portability. This purely <a href="#">mechanical</a> hand-held device could do
          addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s
          electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical
          calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.

    <br> 
The first mainframe <a href="#">computers</a>, initially using vacuum tubes and later transistors in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. Electronic circuits developed for computers also had application to electronic calculators.

The Casio Computer Company, in <b>Japan</b>, released the Model 14-A calculator in 1957, which was the world's first all-electric (relatively) compact calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on relay technology, and was built into a desk. The IBM 608 plugboard programmable calculator was IBM's first all-transistor product, released in 1957; this was a console type system, with input and output on punched cards, and replaced the earlier, larger, vacuum-tube IBM 603.

Early calculator light-emitting <strong>diode</strong> (LED) display from the 1970s (USSR)
In October 1961, the world's first all-electronic desktop calculator, the British Bell Punch/Sumlock Comptometer ANITA (A New Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting) was announced.[19][20] This machine used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode tubes and Dekatrons in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode "Nixie" tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical comptometers of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later Sharp CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly 33 pounds (15 kg) due to its large tube system.[21] Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names "Plus" and "Sumlock", and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British Pilot ACE computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.

<br>
The tube technology of the <a href="#">ANITA</a> was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured Friden EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a 5-inch (13 cm) cathode ray tube (CRT), and introduced Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: Sharp introduced the CS-10A, which weighed 25 kilograms (55 lb) and cost 500,000 yen ($4555.81), and Industria Macchine Elettroniche of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time). The Victor 3900 was the first to use integrated circuits in place of individual transistors, but production problems delayed sales until 1966.


The Bulgarian ELKA 22 from 1967
There followed a series of electronic <a href="#">calculator</a> models from these and other manufacturers, including Canon, Mathatronics, Olivetti, SCM (Smith-Corona-Marchant), Sony, Toshiba, and Wang. The early calculators used hundreds of germanium transistors, which were cheaper than silicon transistors, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were CRT, cold-cathode Nixie tubes, and filament lamps. Memory technology was usually based on the delay-line memory or the magnetic-core memory, though the Toshiba "Toscal" BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of dynamic RAM built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.

<p  class="pone">picture:The Bulgarian ELKA 22 from 1967</p>
<br>
Bulgaria's ELKA 6521,[22][23] introduced in 1965, was developed by the Central Institute for Calculation Technologies and built at the Elektronika factory in Sofia. The name derives from ELektronen KAlkulator, and it weighed around 8 kg (18 lb). It is the first calculator in the world which includes the square root function. Later that same year were released the ELKA 22 (with a luminescent display)[22][24][25] and the ELKA 25, with an built-in printer. Several other models were developed until the first pocket model, the ELKA 101, was released in 1974. The writing on it was in Roman script, and it was exported to western countries.[22][26][27][28]
