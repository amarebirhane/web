              During the Apollo missions, an on-board computer and large
              computers on Earth performed the critical guidance and navigation
              calculations necessary for a successful journey. In addition,
              crews carried a slide rule for more routine calculations. NASA
              chose a 5-inch, metal rule, model "N600-ES," manufactured by the
              Pickett Company for their use. It was a model that was popular
              among engineers, scientists and students at the time. No
              modifications were needed for use in space.

              I believe that this nation should <strong>commit</strong> itself
              to achieving the goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of
              landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.
              No single space project in this period will be more impressive to
              mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of
              space; and none will be so difficult or

              to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the
              appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate
              <u>liquid and solid fuel boosters</u>, much larger than any now
              being developed, until certain which is superior.
              <span>We propose additional</span>
              funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations—
              explorations which are particularly important for one purpose
              which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who
              first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will
              not be one man going to the Moon—if we make this judgment
              affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must
              work to put him there.
