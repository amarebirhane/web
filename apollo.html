        <h2>the Role Of Calculator in Apollo Mission</h2>
        <p>
          During the Apollo missions, an on-board computer and large computers
          on Earth performed the critical guidance and navigation calculations
          necessary for a successful journey. In addition, crews carried a slide
          rule for more routine calculations. NASA chose a 5-inch, metal rule,
          model "N600-ES," manufactured by the Pickett Company for their use. It
          was a model that was popular among engineers, scientists and students
          at the time. No modifications were needed for use in space.

          I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal,
          before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing a man on the Moon and
          returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this
          period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the
          long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or
          expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of
          the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate
          liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being
          developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional
          funds for other engine development and for unmanned
          explorations—explorations which are particularly important for one
          purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man
          who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will
          not be one man going to the Moon—if we make this judgment
          affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to
          put him there
